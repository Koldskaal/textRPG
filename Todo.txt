Features I'd like to implement, todo:
    - lifesteal
    - live updating player stats panel
    - equipment "room", en måde at equippe ting
    - equipment overview panel, under stats panel(måske unødvendigt)
    - spells system
    - extended combat system, til at inkorporere spells og andre sjove ting
    - inventory + inventory "room" to browse/use items.
    - level up "room", flere valg når man leveler up.
    - talent tree! evt random of 3 options pr level up. big choices.
    - Risk reward play options
      - low health kills = more reward
      - low health = more mana
      - potions to xp

    -roguelike: no stats, only hp+mana on lvlup. On death ->
                higher stats for next run.

Other:
  equipment
  game tick timer

  dodge puzzles
  character creation (simple deploy x amount of base stats?)
