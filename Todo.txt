Features I'd like to implement, todo:
    - equipment overview panel, under stats panel(måske unødvendigt)
    - spells system
    - level up "room", flere valg når man leveler up.
    - Risk reward play options
      - low health kills = more reward
      - low health = more mana
      - potions to xp

    -roguelike: no stats, only hp+mana on lvlup. On death ->
                higher stats for next run.

Other:
  game tick timer
  puzzles
  dodge puzzles
  character creation (simple deploy x amount of base stats?)
  Main menu
  saving progress?
